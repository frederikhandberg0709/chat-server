As a portfolio project, I have decided to build a chat application similar to Facebook Messenger.

This repository serves as the backend for the chat application.
There will also be a repository exclusively for the frontend, which will include a web application and possibly a mobile app as well.

I have only recently started working on this project, so there is still much work to be done on the backend.

The backend REST server is being built using Spring Boot, as it is a popular choice and I have some experience with it already from college.
